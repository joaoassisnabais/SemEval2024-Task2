We will consider a PFS of 50% at twelve months (median PFS of 12 months) or less uninteresting and a PFS of 70% at twelve months (median PFS of twenty months) worthy of pursuing the regimen in a future trials. The single-stage design is as follows: p0=0.50, p1=0.70, \u03b1=0.10, \u03b2= 0.10. This leads to a total sample size of 39 patients, 24 or higher of who are progression-free at 12 months.",
