CTRs elaborate on the procedures and findings of clinical trials, scrutinizing the effectiveness and safety of novel treatments. Each trial involves cohorts or arms exposed to distinct treatments or exhibiting diverse baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA delineating conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION particulars specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary encompassing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS cataloging signs and symptoms observed. Statements posit claims regarding the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or in comparative analysis of two. To establish entailment, the statement's assertion should harmonize with clinical trial data, find substantiation in the CTR, and avoid contradiction with the provided descriptions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe following descriptions correspond to the information in one or more Clinical Trial Report (CTR) sections.\n\nPrimary Trial: $primary_evidence\n\nSecondary Trial (Optional): $secondary_evidence\n\nAn expert in clinical trials has crafted the following statement: $hypothesis\n\nYour task is to determine whether it's possible to validate this statement based on the provided Clinical Trial Report (CTR) information. The statement should be supported by the CTR data and not contradict the given descriptions.\n\nPlease follow these steps in your reasoning:\n\n1. Analyze the primary trial evidence, identifying key points relevant to the expert's statement.\n2. If provided, examine the secondary trial evidence and note any additional relevant information.\n3. Compare the expert's statement to the evidence from both trials.\n4. Consider any potential contradictions or gaps in the information.\n5. Evaluate whether there's sufficient evidence to support or refute the statement.\n6. Explain your thought process, highlighting the connections between the evidence and the statement.\n\nAfter providing your chain of reasoning, conclude with a final answer of ENTAILMENT or CONTRADICTION to indicate whether it's possible to determine the statement's validity based on the CTR information.\n\nChain of Thought:\n[Provide your step-by-step reasoning here]\n\nFinal Answer: [ENTAILMENT/CONTRADICTION]<|eot_id|>",
