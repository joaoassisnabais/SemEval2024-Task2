CTRs elaborate on the procedures and findings of clinical trials, scrutinizing the effectiveness and safety of novel treatments. Each trial involves cohorts or arms exposed to distinct treatments or exhibiting diverse baseline characteristics. Comprehensive CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA delineating conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION particulars specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary encompassing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS cataloging signs and symptoms observed. Statements posit claims regarding the information within these sections, either for a single CTR or in comparative analysis of two. To establish entailment, the statement's assertion should harmonize with clinical trial data, find substantiation in the CTR, and avoid contradiction with the provided descriptions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe following descriptions correspond to the information in one or more Clinical Trial Report (CTR) sections.\n\nPrimary Trial: $primary_evidence\n\nSecondary Trial (Optional): $secondary_evidence\n\nAn expert in clinical trials has crafted the following statement: $hypothesis\n\nYour task is to determine whether it's possible to validate this statement based on the provided Clinical Trial Report (CTR) information. The statement should be supported by the CTR data and not contradict the given descriptions.\n\nPlease follow these steps in your reasoning:\n\n1. Analyze the primary trial evidence, identifying key points relevant to the expert's statement.\n2. If provided, examine the secondary trial evidence and note any additional relevant information.\n3. Compare the expert's statement to the evidence from both trials.\n4. Consider any potential contradictions or gaps in the information.\n5. Evaluate whether there's sufficient evidence to support or refute the statement.\n6. Explain your thought process, highlighting the connections between the evidence and the statement.\n\nAfter providing your chain of reasoning, conclude with a final answer of ENTAILMENT or CONTRADICTION to indicate whether it's possible to determine the statement's validity based on the CTR information.\n\nChain of Thought:\n[Provide your step-by-step reasoning here]\n\nFinal Answer: [ENTAILMENT/CONTRADICTION]<|eot_id|>",

For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.\n  Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or biopsy.\n  Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate hepatic function.\n  The following criteria for evidence of adequate renal function must be met:\n  Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.\n  Calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than 50 mL/min.\n  Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.\n  Patients must have their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. The LVEF must be greater than/equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the cardiac imaging facility performing the MUGA scan or echocardiogram. Note: If the cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value.\n  Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be repeated prior to study entry. The lower of the two LVEF values should be used as the baseline LVEF.\n  Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) within 3 months prior to study entry.\nExclusion Criteria:\n  Tumor determined to be strongly HER2-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (positive for gene amplification).\n  Excisional biopsy for this primary tumor.\n  Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer.\n  Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry (Exceptions: 1) fine needle aspiration (FNA) of an axillary node is permitted for any patient, and 2) although not recommended, a sentinel lymph node biopsy for patients with clinically negative axillary nodes is permitted.)\n  History of any of the following cancers:\n  Ipsilateral breast cancer: invasive, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with any therapy other than excision\n  Contralateral breast cancer: invasive within the past 5 years (Patients with history of DCIS or synchronous DCIS are eligible)\n  History of non-breast malignancies within the 5 years prior to study entry. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the previous 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n  Prior therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, capecitabine, or bevacizumab for any malignancy.\n  Treatment including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to study entry. The only exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before study entry and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy.\n  Any of the following cardiac conditions:\n  angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication;\n  history of documented congestive heart failure;\n  serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication;\n  severe conduction abnormality;\n  valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise; or\n  uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 150/90 on antihypertensive therapy. (Patients with hypertension that is well controlled on medication are eligible.)\n  History of myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of left ventricular (LV) function.\n  History of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA).\n  History of other arterial thrombotic event within 12 months before study entry.\n  Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.\n  Any significant bleeding within 6 months before study entry.\n  Serious or non-healing wound, skin ulcers, or bone fracture.\n  Gastroduodenal ulcer(s) determined by endoscopy to be active.\n  Invasive procedures defined as follows:\n  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to planned start of study therapy.

Encourage patients to adhere to drug treatment and to comply with this research program; The operation of CBT and clinical management should be conducted by the same person as far as possible.\nINTERVENTION 2: \n  Stage 1 CBT\n  The experimental group will receive CBT each session.\n  CBT and clinical management: The subjects will receive standardized CBT treatment regularly for 9 sessions(once per week in the first month and once half a month in the second and third months), and each session will last for about 60 minutes.The treatment includes three steps:Concept stage (the first and second sessions): establishment of therapeutic relationships with the subjects; Skills acquisition and repeat stage (the third session to the 8th session): clarification of sources of stress, patients' cognitive and behavioral response to stress. Application and complete price segment (the 9th session): return visit to test efficacy of psychological intervention.",
