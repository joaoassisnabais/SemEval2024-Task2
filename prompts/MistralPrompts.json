        "5_5_5_5": "<s>[INST]Consider the problem of assessing semantic entailment connections between distinct sections of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and statements put forth by clinical domain experts. To establish entailment, the statement's assertion should be supported from the CTR, not contradicting the provided descriptions. In brief, CTRs elucidate the procedures and findings of clinical trials, evaluating the efficacy and safety of emerging treatments.
